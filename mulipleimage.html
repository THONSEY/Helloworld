            With traditional career doors slamming
            shut, it’s easy to panic, but Chris Guillebeau
            sees opportunities everywhere. Making a
            career out of your passion sounds like
            a dream, but in this straightforward,
            engaging book he shows you how to
            get it done, one simple step at a time.”
            —Alan Paul, author of Big in China
            More than a decade ago, I began a lifelong
            journey of self-employment by any means
            necessary. I never planned to be an entrepreneur; I just didn’t want to work for
            someone else. From a cheap apartment in
            Memphis, Tennessee, I watched what other
            people had done and tried to reverse-engineer their success. I started by importing coffee from Jamaica, selling it
            online because I
            saw other people making money from it; I
            didn’t have any special skills in importing,
            roasting, or selling. (I did, however, consume
            much of the product through frequent
            “testing.”)
